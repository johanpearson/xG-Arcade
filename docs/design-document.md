## 1. Direction

**Brief:** modern and clean, not dark. Lean on real football imagery —
flags and club badges — rather than a broadcast-graphics palette.

**Why this, not the obvious defaults:** the previous direction (dark
background + gold/teal accents) was a reasonable idea but landed as generic
"dark mode analytics dashboard" — a look that has nothing to do with
football specifically and reads as an AI default regardless of subject.
Football already has strong, recognizable visual identity built in: flags
and club crests are instantly legible symbols people already know. The
distinctive move here isn't inventing a new color language — it's getting
out of the way and letting those symbols do the work, on a clean light
surface that doesn't compete with them.

**Imagery note:** flags are rendered as standard flag emoji/Unicode — safe,
universal, no licensing concern, shipped in v1. Club crests are **deferred
to Phase 2** — v1 ships with the placeholder circular initial-badges shown
throughout this document as the actual design, not a temporary stand-in.
Real crest sourcing via API-Football (`ClubCrest` caching, see
`implementation-document.md` and ADR-0007/0008) is designed and ready to
build, but intentionally not part of v1 scope — see
`requirements-document.md` §6. When it does ship, the initial-badge becomes
the fallback for any club without a crest on file, not something removed
entirely.

## 2. Token system

**Color** (light theme only for v1):

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `bg-base` | `#FBFBFA` | App background — a very slightly warm off-white, not stark clinical white and not the generic cream-default either |
| `surface-card` | `#FFFFFF` | Grid cells, cards — pure white against the slightly warm base, so cards lift without needing a shadow to do all the work |
| `surface-sunken` | `#F1F2F0` | Empty/inactive cells, input backgrounds — recessed relative to cards |
| `text-primary` | `#1A1F1C` | Primary text — near-black with a faint green undertone, not pure black |
| `text-muted` | `#6B7570` | Secondary text, labels, captions |
| `border-hairline` | `#E4E6E3` | All dividers and card borders — thin, quiet, never a heavy box |
| `accent-green` | `#1E9E63` | Live/active states, primary actions — a clean pitch green, crisp rather than dark/muted. Non-text/decorative use only (live-dot, focus ring, tab underline) — see `accent-green-text` below for text/icon/button-label use |
| `accent-gold` | `#C99A2E` | Reserved for future non-text/decorative correct/locked-final use (e.g. a Phase 2 badge fill) — see `accent-gold-text` below for text/icon use, which is everywhere Tier 0 actually paints "correct" today on a light background. **Exception (2026-07-18, REQ-214):** this token, not `accent-gold-text`, is the correct choice for the checkmark/points text/icon overlaid on the `overlay-scrim` token below — see that row for why the darker/lighter split flips on a dark backdrop |
| `accent-red` | `#C4463C` | Incorrect states — a muted brick red, not an alarm red. Passes text contrast as-is (~4.9:1 on white) — no separate text variant needed |
| `accent-green-text` | `#187E4F` | **(S-013)** Green text/icon labels, and white-on-green button-label backgrounds (`.guess-input__submit`, `.auth-screen__submit`) — `accent-green` itself measures ~3.4:1 against `surface-card`/white, below WCAG AA's 4.5:1 for normal text; this darkened variant measures ~5.1:1 |
| `accent-gold-text` | `#8D6C20` | **(S-013)** Correct/locked-final text and icons (`CellState`'s correct icon + meta line) — `accent-gold` itself measures ~2.6:1 against `surface-card`/white, failing even the 3:1 floor for large text/icons; this darkened variant measures ~4.9:1 |
| `accent-green-scrim` | `#23B874` | **Exception (2026-07-19, REQ-214, direct user feedback on the shipped photo-fill-cell treatment):** the color of the checkmark glyph only (never the points value beside it, which stays `accent-gold` per the `overlay-scrim` row below) when it's overlaid on a correct cell's at-rest photo. Neither existing green token clears WCAG AA's 4.5:1 floor against the scrim's own worst-case blended background (`rgb(51, 56, 53)` — see `overlay-scrim`'s row for the full derivation): `accent-green` (`#1E9E63`) measures **3.49:1**, and `accent-green-text` (`#187E4F`), being darker still, measures even lower — both fail. This is therefore a new value, not a reuse of an existing token: same hue as `accent-green` (152°), same saturation (68%), lightness raised to 43% (from `accent-green`'s 37%) — `#23B874` — measured at **4.65:1** against the same `rgb(51, 56, 53)` worst-case backdrop, ~3% above the 4.5:1 floor as a safety margin against rendering variance, matching the margin `overlay-scrim`'s own gold math targets. One percentage point of HSL lightness lower (42%, `#21AB6B`) drops to 4.46:1 and fails — 43% is the practical floor at whole-percent lightness granularity, the same style of verification `overlay-scrim`'s 89%-vs-88% check used. **This is a deliberate, one-off semantic exception, not a new general-purpose "correct" color:** every other correct-state signal in the app — this table's `accent-gold-text`, and `accent-gold` on this very scrim for the points value sitting right beside this same checkmark — is gold, per "Green means live/active, gold means settled/correct" below. The user explicitly asked for this one checkmark, and only this one, to render green instead, after seeing the shipped gold-on-photo treatment; it does not extend to any other correct-checkmark instance in the app (the non-photo checkmark elsewhere in this table remains `accent-gold-text`, unchanged) and must not be reused elsewhere as a general "correct" color without the same explicit, direct call. |
| `overlay-scrim` | `rgba(26, 31, 28, 0.89)` | **(2026-07-18, REQ-214; lightened same day after visual feedback that the original 94% read as a heavy black shadow, not a scrim)** Backdrop behind the checkmark/points value (and the name/badge dock, once revealed) when they're overlaid on a correct cell's at-rest photo (`SCREEN-01a` states 1/4's photo mocks) — a bottom-anchored band behind that content only, not a wash across the whole photo. Same hue as `text-primary`. Opacity was chosen as the *lightest* value (most photo showing through) that still clears WCAG AA's 4.5:1 contrast floor for both overlaid foreground colors, measured against the *worst case* (a pure-white photo showing through the remaining 11%), not a typical photo — relative-luminance formula, `rgb(26, 31, 28)` alpha-blended over `#FFFFFF`: at 89%, the blended backdrop is `rgb(51, 56, 53)`, giving `accent-gold` (`#C99A2E`) a contrast ratio of **4.65:1** and `surface-card`/white a ratio of **11.99:1** against it — both clear 4.5:1, with `accent-gold` (the tighter of the two) landing ~3% above the floor rather than exactly on it, as a safety margin against rendering variance (anti-aliasing, photo compression artifacts) rather than relying on an exact knife-edge value. One point lower, at 88%, `accent-gold` drops to 4.49:1 and fails — 89% is therefore the practical floor at whole-percent granularity. Against a typical (non-white) photo the effective contrast is higher still, since most real photos are darker than pure white. **On this token specifically, use `accent-gold` (not `accent-gold-text`) for the overlaid points text/icon** — the reverse of every other text/icon use in this table: `accent-gold-text` was darkened *because* `accent-gold` fails contrast on a light (`surface-card`/white) background, but that same lighter, more saturated `accent-gold` is what actually clears 4.5:1 on this dark background; `accent-gold-text` would under-perform here (calibrated the opposite direction) and must not be reused on this token. **(2026-07-19 update)** the checkmark glyph specifically no longer follows this same gold pairing — see `accent-green-scrim` above, added the same day after direct user feedback asking for the checkmark (not the points value) to be green on this scrim; the gold pairing described in this paragraph still governs the points value and remains correct for it. **The revealed name (REQ-212) also sits on this scrim once shown, and needs the same treatment** — it has no correct/incorrect semantic color of its own (unlike the checkmark/points), so it normally renders in `text-primary` (near-black), which is illegible here for the same reason `accent-gold-text` is: use `surface-card` (white) for the name specifically when it's shown on this scrim, the lightest neutral already in this table rather than a new token. |

Green means "live/active," gold means "settled/correct" — same semantic
split as before, just recolored for a light surface. This distinction is
load-bearing (REQ-205) so it must stay consistent everywhere. Flags and
badges bring in their own natural colors on top of this neutral shell —
the UI is deliberately quiet so those images read clearly, not muddied by
a busy background.

**Acknowledged exception (2026-07-19, REQ-214):** the checkmark overlaid
on a correct cell's at-rest photo is `accent-green-scrim` (see §2's table
row above), not gold — a direct, explicit user request scoped to that one
glyph, made after seeing the shipped gold-on-photo treatment. This breaks
the green/gold split described in this paragraph for that single instance:
the photo-overlay checkmark still means "correct," same as everywhere
else, but is rendered in the "live" hue. It is recorded here plainly as a
deliberate one-off, not a reinterpretation of the rule — every other
correct-checkmark instance in the app (including the points value sitting
directly beside this same checkmark) is still gold, and any future
correct-state color choice should still default to gold unless someone
makes the same kind of explicit call again.

**Text vs. decorative contrast (S-013, resolves §6's former open
item):** §6's contrast floor requires verifying gold-on-white and
green-on-white use once real components existed — S-013 measured both
(WCAG relative-luminance formula against `surface-card`/`#FFFFFF`) and
found `accent-gold` and `accent-green` both fail the required ratio when
used as text/icon color or as a solid button fill behind white
label text (2.6:1 and 3.4:1 respectively, against a 4.5:1 normal-text /
3:1 large-text-and-graphical-object floor). `accent-gold-text`/
`accent-green-text` above are darkened, same-hue variants that pass; the
original tokens remain defined for non-text/decorative use, where the
lighter, more saturated hue was the deliberate intent and the applicable
floor (3:1, non-text UI components) is already met (e.g. `accent-green`'s
live-dot against a card background measures the same ~3.4:1, which
clears 3:1 fine for a decorative indicator).

**Type:**

| Role | Typeface | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Display / headings | Space Grotesk | Geometric, slightly technical, carried over from v0.1 — it works independently of the light/dark question |
| Body / UI | Inter | Restrained, quiet — personality lives in imagery and data, not body text |
| Data / numerals | IBM Plex Mono, tabular figures | Every score, percentage, and countdown — keeps numbers precise and comparable at a glance |

Rule unchanged from v0.1: any number meant to be compared at a glance is
always in the mono face with tabular figures.

**Layout concept:**

- The grid remains the hero — never compressed for a headline treatment.
- Flags and badges are always paired with their text label, never used
  alone as the only identifier (accessibility — see §6) — a cell reads
  "🇫🇷 France × [AFC badge] Arsenal," not just two icons.
- Generous whitespace on `bg-base`, with cards as the only bordered
  elements — avoids the boxy, templated-dashboard feel that a dark theme
  with heavy card borders tends toward.
- Hairline dividers, not shadows, separate sections — kept from v0.1,
  still correct for a clean direction.

**Signature element: badge dock.** When a player clicks/taps a locked,
correct cell to reveal the guessed player (REQ-212, SCREEN-01a), the row's
flag/badge and the column's badge slide inward from either side and settle
next to the now-visible player name — a small, literal "match" animation
tied directly to the game's actual mechanic (combining two categories), not
a borrowed broadcast trope. This replaces v0.1's split-flap animation,
which was a retro-broadcast flourish that didn't fit a clean, light
direction. **S-041 note:** before that story, this animated at guess-submit
and round-close instead, since the name was shown automatically at one of
those two moments; now that the name is never shown until the player
actively reveals it, the animation moved to that reveal moment instead
(replaying on every reveal, not just the first) — same animation, same
visual meaning ("badges settle beside a newly-visible name"), just tied to
the new trigger that's actually meaningful under S-041's interaction model.
Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`: badges appear already docked, no slide,
with a brief background color flash (green→gold) instead.

**Rejected-guess cue (S-020).** When a submitted guess is rejected, the
cell gives a literal, immediate "no match" cue: a brief lateral shake
paired with a red background flash that fades back to transparent.
Mechanically and visually distinct from the badge dock above — it's
triggered by a *rejection*, not a match, uses a shake rather than a slide,
and never touches the badge-dock elements or its keyframes. Fires on
every rejected guess (whether or not an attempt remains afterward), never
on a page load that shows a cell already incorrect. Respects
`prefers-reduced-motion`: flash only, no shake.

## 3. Key screens

### SCREEN-01: Grid (home)

```
Mobile (single column)                Desktop (grid + side panel)
┌─────────────────────────┐           ┌───────────────────────────────────┐

│ 🇧🇷 │  +  │ Kaká │  +  │           │   (same as left)   │                │
│ 🇪🇸 │  +  │  ✕  │  +  │           │                    │  ~69 pts       │
│                          │           │                    │  estimated     │
│ ~69 pts estimated         │           └────────────────────┴───────────────┘
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**S-029:** the running total shown here (REQ-206) uses the same "~N pts
estimated" wording as a single cell's own live point value (REQ-204/S-018)
— it's the sum of whatever per-cell live estimates are already known, not a
promise of the locked total the leaderboard shows once the round closes.
Only shown once at least one cell's live point value is known (never a
fabricated "0" while nothing has been correctly guessed yet). This is a
running-total display, distinct from SCREEN-01a's per-cell value — S-041
only simplified the latter; this line's "~N pts estimated" wording is
unchanged.

**S-041 addition:** the `(ⓘ)` entry point next to the round timer opens
SCREEN-06, the general scoring/live-updates explainer (REQ-213) — see that
section for content and interaction. It replaces the per-cell disclosure
SCREEN-01a used to carry (see that section's own S-041 note) as the one
place a player learns what a live vs. locked point value means, instead of
that explanation being repeated, cell by cell, across the grid.

- Row headers: flag + country name when the row category is a nationality;
  a club badge + club name when the row category is a club (REQ-107 means
  a grid is always Club×Club or Club×Country, never Country×Country, so at
  most one axis is ever flags — the other is always badges).
  Column headers follow the same rule for whichever axis they represent.
- An empty cell shows a faint "+" with no imagery — imagery only appears
  once a cell has an answer, so an unanswered grid doesn't feel cluttered.
- A correct cell (live or locked): checkmark plus a points value only — see
  SCREEN-01a's S-041 note for the full redesign; no per-cell live/final
  distinction exists anymore.
- An incorrect cell with an attempt remaining: red cross, "N attempt(s)
  left" text (SCREEN-01a state 2, unaffected by S-041).
- An incorrect, locked cell (out of attempts, or the round closed):
  red cross plus a points value only — see SCREEN-01a state 3's S-033
  note; no "no attempts left"/"final" qualifier text, matching a correct
  cell's own "checkmark plus points, nothing else" structure above.
- Desktop's side panel is additive only — mobile gets the same information
  stacked below the grid.

**Status note (2026-07-14):** only the mobile single-column layout above
has actually been built — the desktop side-panel variant shown in the mock
was never implemented; every viewport currently gets the single-column
layout, stretched to `.app`'s `max-width: 900px` cap. Direct product
feedback found this reads as small/stuck-top-left with unused space around
it on a genuinely wide viewport, since the layout was never art-directed
past that cap. `docs/backlog.md` S-040 polishes the single-column layout's
own spacing/sizing at wide viewports; the side-panel variant itself remains
explicitly deferred to a separate, not-yet-scoped future story, not
silently dropped.

### SCREEN-01a: Cell states (component, appears within cells)

Four distinct states now exist per REQ-210, not two — correctness is
revealed immediately (REQ-203), separate from whether the round has closed:

**1. Correct, round still active** (locked from further guessing, score
still live until round close):

```
At rest, no photo (default when the resolved player has none):
┌─────────────────────────┐
│                     ✓     │   ← gold checkmark — no dot, no "live" text,
│  12 pts                   │     no name until clicked/tapped
└─────────────────────────┘

At rest, photo available (2026-07-18 — REQ-214 status note):
┌─────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────┘        below (still no name here — that's
                                     still REQ-212's click/tap gate,
                                     unaffected by this note)

Revealed, no photo (click/tap the cell — toggles closed again on a
second click/tap; unchanged from before this note):
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Henry                ✓   │
│  12 pts                   │
└─────────────────────────┘

Revealed, photo available (same click/tap toggle; the photo itself does
not react to the toggle — only the name/badge dock do):
┌─────────────────────────┐
│▒▒▒▒▒▒[ player photo,▒▒▒▒▒│
│▒▒▒▒▒▒unchanged ]▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒│
│▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓│    ← same scrim strip, now also carrying

│▓ 12 pts                   │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**REQ-214 status note (2026-07-18): photo decoupled from the click/tap
reveal.** Supersedes this section's own "Revealed, photo available" mock as
it read immediately after REQ-214 first shipped (photo appearing only once
revealed, alongside the name) — requested directly by the user after seeing
that version live. The photo now shows automatically at rest, filling the
cell, whenever the resolved player has one; the click/tap toggle (REQ-212,
unchanged) continues to govern only the name and badge dock, and no longer
gates the photo at all. Practically: a correct cell with a photo now shows
that photo immediately once locked, before the player has clicked/tapped
anything; clicking/tapping it afterward adds the name on top (and over the
photo, if present) exactly as REQ-212 already specified, without changing
whether the photo itself is showing. The checkmark and points value are
overlaid on the photo (a scrim/shadow strip behind them, shown as the `▓`
band above) rather than sitting on a plain card background — see this
section's REQ-214 implementation note below for why no dedicated overlay
token exists yet for this treatment. The no-photo mock and behavior above
are unaffected by this note.

**S-041 redesign (supersedes S-040's mock above):** further direct product
feedback found the live/final distinction S-040 preserved (a pulsing dot,
the word "live," the "~N pts estimated" qualifier, and the S-019 tap/hover/
focus toggle revealing a %-breakdown + round-end-time line) was itself
unnecessary noise — a player doesn't need any of that per cell to know
their score, just the number. The dot, "live" text, "~"/"estimated"
wording, and the whole %-breakdown/round-end disclosure are gone. At rest:
checkmark plus the live point estimate, full stop — identical in structure
to state 4 below (see that state's own note). A player cannot tell from
the cell alone whether the shown value could still change before round
close; that's now explained once, generally, by SCREEN-06's explainer
(REQ-213), not repeated per cell. What the %-breakdown disclosure used to
gate (the player name + badge dock) is now gated by a **click/tap
anywhere on the cell** instead — replacing S-019's three-way click/hover/
focus toggle on a small in-cell button with one interaction, the same on
every device (REQ-212). `aria-expanded` on the cell itself still reflects
open/closed state, so keyboard/screen-reader access is unchanged in kind,
just simpler in mechanism. When no live point value exists yet (a guess
just submitted, value not back from the server), the cell shows the
checkmark with no points line at all — the name still isn't shown until
clicked, same click/tap interaction either way (there is no longer a
"nothing to disclose, so skip the toggle" fallback S-019/S-040 needed,
since the click target is the whole cell rather than a button next to
optional live text).

**Superseded by S-041 (kept for history):** the S-040 mock's dot/"live"
text/always-visible "~N pts estimated" qualifier, and the S-019/S-029/S-040
tap-or-hover/focus toggle revealing "N% of others guessed this too · ~N pts
estimated" plus "updates until round closes on [date/time]." None of that
content is shown per cell anymore — see SCREEN-06.

**2. Incorrect, one attempt remaining:**

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│                     ✕      │   ← red cross, not locked — no name shown
│  1 attempt left           │   ← always spelled out, never just an icon
└─────────────────────────┘
      ↑ rejected-guess cue (S-020) plays once here: a brief shake + red
        flash, distinct from the badge dock above — see §2
```

**S-029:** a wrong guess shows no name at all, not even the text the
player typed — just the ✕ and the attempt count. Earlier versions of this
mock (and the shipped code, until now) showed the as-typed guess
("Ronaldinho" above) even when wrong; a player-feedback pass found this
unhelpful (a wrong guess isn't useful information) and, worse, inconsistent
with the *correct* case's canonical-cased name (a wrong guess showed
whatever casing the player happened to type). Removed entirely for the
incorrect states rather than partially fixed.

**3. Incorrect, no attempts remaining** (round still active, cell is done):

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│                     ✕      │   ← no name shown, same as state 2
│  100 pts                  │   ← guaranteed worst score (ADR-0021) —
└─────────────────────────┘      same minimal structure as a correct
      ↑ same rejected-guess cue     cell, no extra qualifier text
        plays here too, on the
        guess that used up the
        last attempt
```

**Simplified (2026-07-14), reported directly by a player:** this state
used to also spell out "no attempts left" alongside the points ("no
attempts left · 100 pts") — once the points value itself was added
(S-033), that qualifier read as redundant: the points alone already say
"this cell is done," the same way a correct cell's points say so without
needing to add "correct" in words. Dropped in favor of matching a correct
cell's own minimal "✕/✓ + points, nothing else" structure exactly. This
also now applies uniformly to state 4's incorrect outcome below (round
closed) — both render identically ("✕ 100 pts"), since `MaxPointsPerCell`
is the same guaranteed value regardless of *when* the cell locked, and a
player can't (and per REQ-204 shouldn't need to) tell from the cell alone
whether the round itself is still active or already closed; see SCREEN-06
for where that's explained generally instead. State 2 (an attempt still
remains) is unaffected — "N attempt(s) left" stays, since that's genuinely
actionable information, not a redundant status label.

**ADR-0021:** an incorrect/exhausted cell locks at `MaxPointsPerCell` (100
by default), not 0 — xG Arcade is scored like golf, so 0 is the *best*
possible score and must never be free just for guessing wrong.

**4. Round closed** (either prior state, now permanent):

```

**REQ-214 implementation note (frontend half, 2026-07-18, as first
shipped) — superseded, kept for history:** the paragraph that originally
stood here described the photo as a small 18px circular avatar shown
*beside* the name, appearing/disappearing with REQ-212's click/tap reveal
toggle exactly like the name did (reusing `.category-label__badge--small`'s
existing 18px circle token, since no dedicated avatar/photo token existed).
That presentation is no longer current — see the "Photo decoupled from the
click/tap reveal" status note above state 2 and the mocks directly above
this note. The 18px-circle reuse and its "appears/disappears with the
name" behavior are both superseded by the fill-the-cell, always-at-rest
treatment now specified; this paragraph is kept only so the prior shipped
behavior isn't lost from the record.

**REQ-214 implementation note (fill-cell treatment, 2026-07-18 status
note):** the photo now fills the cell's full footprint at rest — same
fixed cell width/height as the no-photo case, `object-fit: cover` so the
source image crops to fill rather than distorting or resizing the cell.
Mechanically, the photo layer is taken out of the cell's own normal-flow
box (absolutely positioned, filling the button's full box edge-to-edge,
deliberately ignoring the button's own padding so the photo can bleed to
the cell's corners as the mock shows) rather than being sized by its own
content — the same "the image can never grow the box" guarantee the
now-superseded 18px avatar-circle used a fixed pixel size for, just
achieved differently now that the photo fills the whole cell instead of a
small slot. **§2 now has a real `overlay-scrim` token** (added the same
day this note was written) for the text-or-icon-on-photo contrast problem
this note used to flag as an open gap — a solid, near-opaque bottom band
behind the checkmark/points (and the name/badge dock, once revealed), not
a wash across the whole photo; see that token's own row for the exact
value, the worst-case-photo contrast verification, and the
`accent-gold`-not-`accent-gold-text` foreground-color call that goes with
it (the two darkened/lightened token pairs in this document are calibrated
for opposite background directions — light `surface-card` vs. this dark
scrim — so the "always use the darkened `-text` variant" habit that holds
everywhere else in this document is specifically wrong on this one token).
No broken-image icon, no loading spinner, and no error text for a missing/
failed photo — that state is visually and behaviorally identical to
today's no-photo at-rest display (same DOM shape, no scrim/overlay layer
rendered at all in that case). Cell footprint (width/height) is a literal
constant regardless of whether a photo is present, absent, or fails to
load — this is a hard, testable constraint (REQ-214), not a visual
preference.

**S-041 redesign (supersedes S-040's mock above):** same redesign as state
1 above, applied here too — no more dot/"live"/"final" text distinguishing
a closed cell from a still-live one (a player can't tell which from the
cell alone, by design; see SCREEN-06), and no more %-breakdown disclosure.
At rest: checkmark plus `FinalPoints`, identical in structure to state 1's
checkmark-plus-live-estimate — the two states differ only in *which*
points value is shown, not in how it's displayed. Click/tap anywhere on
the cell reveals the guessed player's name and badge dock, same single
interaction as state 1 (REQ-212), replacing S-040's reveal toggle (which
itself had replaced no toggle at all, before that). The incorrect-outcome
half of state 4 is unaffected by the reveal/name change specifically — it
already showed no name (S-029) and still isn't a click target, since
there's nothing to reveal — but its points display was simplified
alongside state 3's (see that state's own 2026-07-14 note): both now show
"✕ 100 pts" with no "no attempts left"/"final" qualifier, using the
frontend's own `MAX_POINTS_PER_CELL` constant directly rather than a
`FinalPoints` value plumbed from the API — the incorrect-lock value is the
same guaranteed constant regardless of whether the cell locked mid-round
or the round closed around it, so there's nothing round-status-specific
left to compute or wait on here.

"Attempt(s) left" still always appears as text, never color/icon-only
(REQ-204, accessibility) for state 2, the one state that still has
actionable text to show. State 1 and state 4 (and, as of today, state 3)
are deliberately *not* visually distinguishable by round status at
rest — see SCREEN-06 for where that distinction is explained instead.

### SCREEN-02: Guess input

Bottom sheet on mobile, inline popover on desktop — unchanged structurally
from v0.1, recolored for the light theme:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ 🇫🇷 France × [AFC] Arsenal   │
│ 1 of 2 attempts used          │   ← only shown once at least 1 attempt used;
│ ┌───────────────────────────┐│      an untried cell shows no attempt count at all
│ │ Type a player name...     ││
│ └───────────────────────────┘│
│ 👤 Thierry Henry              │
│                               │
│         [ Submit guess ]     │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

- Autocomplete rows show a small silhouette/placeholder avatar next to the
  name where a player photo is available — optional, degrades to text-only
  cleanly if no photo exists, never a broken-image icon.
- The category header itself now doubles as instant visual confirmation of
  what's being asked, via the flag/badge — reduces reliance on reading the
  category names carefully under time pressure.
- Autocomplete is sourced from the broad name index (REQ-207), not the
  narrower validation data — so suggestions appear for many names that
  won't turn out to be correct for this specific cell. That's intentional,
  not a bug to fix visually; nothing in this screen should imply a
  suggested name is already known to be right.

**S-032 implementation note:** shipped without the photo/silhouette avatar
described above — the `PlayerNameIndex`-backed contract this story builds
against (ADR-0007) carries `name`/`birthYear`/`nationality` only, no photo
field, so each suggestion row instead shows the name plus an optional
`nationality · birthYear` caption line in `text-muted` for disambiguation.
Avatar support stays an open item if/when the index gains a photo field.
Judgment calls made without an existing spec to follow, recorded here
rather than left as unreviewed implementation-only detail:
- Suggestions list uses only neutral tokens — `surface-card` background,
  `border-hairline` dividers, `text-primary`/`text-muted` for name/caption,
  and `surface-sunken` (the same "recessed" token already used for an
  untouched input, not a live/correct accent) for the keyboard-highlighted
  row. Deliberately no `accent-green`/`accent-gold` anywhere in this list —
  either would visually suggest a name is "probably right," undermining
  REQ-207's own point.
- Selecting a suggestion (click, or Enter on the keyboard-highlighted row)
  fills the text field only — never auto-submits — so the player always
  takes an explicit, separate "Submit guess" action regardless of how the
  name got into the field.
- Debounced at 275ms after the last keystroke, once the trimmed query
  reaches 2 characters; a failed suggestions fetch is swallowed
  client-side (shows no suggestions, never blocks or errors the guess
  form) since autocomplete is a nice-to-have, not required to submit.
- Standard combobox/listbox ARIA pattern (`role="combobox"` on the input,
  `role="listbox"`/`role="option"` on the suggestion list, with
  `aria-activedescendant` tracking the arrow-key-highlighted option) —
  arrow keys move through suggestions, Enter picks the highlighted one
  (or falls through to the form's normal submit if nothing is
  highlighted), Escape dismisses the list without clearing typed text.

### SCREEN-02a: Disambiguation prompt

Appears only when a submitted name matches more than one real player who
*both* satisfy the cell's categories (REQ-209) — genuinely rare, but must
be handled cleanly rather than silently guessing on the player's behalf.

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Which Ronaldo did you mean?  │
│                               │
│ ○ 👤 Ronaldo (b. 1976)        │
│    Brazil · Real Madrid       │
│                               │
│ ○ 👤 Ronaldo (b. 1993)        │
│    Brazil · Real Madrid       │
│                               │
│         [ Confirm ]          │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

- Single-select list, each option showing enough to actually distinguish
  them (birth year always; nationality/club shown even though both share
  the searched category here, since it still helps recognition).
- This is the only place a bare "which one?" choice is acceptable without
  more context — the alternative (guessing on the player's behalf, or
  rejecting a genuinely correct answer) is worse in both directions.
- If the player abandons this prompt without choosing, the guess is not
  submitted — it does not default to either candidate.

### SCREEN-03: Leaderboard

```
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│ [Global] [My League ▾] [+ New] │
│ Lowest total wins               │
├───────────────────────────────┤
│ 1  Sam         120 pts         │

│ 3  Alex        142 pts         │
├───────────────────────────────┤
│         [ Load more ]          │
└───────────────────────────────┘
```

Unchanged from v0.1 structurally — tabs for Global vs. custom leagues, the
user's row always visually distinct. Recolored: the user's row uses
`surface-sunken` instead of a dark raised surface.

**Pagination (REQ-607, S-034):** a "Load more" control below the list
fetches and appends the next page — outline-fill button (`surface-card`
background, `border-hairline`, `accent-green-text` label), not a second
green CTA. When the requesting user's row isn't among the currently
loaded page(s), a pinned "you" row renders below the list (same
`surface-sunken`/"you"-tag treatment as an in-list row, sticky to the
viewport bottom) so their standing is always visible without loading
further pages. No new tokens — both reuse the existing surface/border/
accent set above.

**ADR-0021 addition:** xG Arcade is scored like golf — lowest total wins,
the opposite of the natural "higher number = better" assumption most
players will bring from other games. The "Lowest total wins" line (plain
text, `text-muted` token, no new color) is added directly under the tab
row specifically to correct that assumption before a player reads any
rank — it must never be omitted or left implicit in the ranking order
alone. Rank #1 is always the lowest `TotalPoints`, consistent with
`LeaderboardService`'s ascending sort.

### SCREEN-04: Admin review (unverified data)

Still deliberately plainer/denser than the rest of the product — a working
tool, not a broadcast surface. On the light theme this now reads as a
clean, ordinary admin table rather than needing its own "un-dark" treatment.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### SCREEN-05: Delete account

```
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│ Delete account                 │
├───────────────────────────────┤

│                    account     │
│                    permanently]│
└───────────────────────────────┘
```

**S-039, REQ-710.** Reached only from a plain "Delete account" link in the
header — deliberately not a general profile/settings page (none exists in
Tier 0). No bare confirmation checkbox: the "current password" field is the
confirmation step REQ-710 already requires server-side (`AuthController
.DeleteAccount` re-verifies it against Supabase Auth before touching
anything), so the UI can't offer a weaker path than the API already
enforces. The warning line uses `accent-red` (text use, already passes the
4.5:1 floor as-is per §2 — no new token needed) and is not color-only: it's
a plain, explicit sentence, not a colored icon or border standing alone.
"Delete my account permanently" (not just "Delete") states the destructive
action plainly, per §5's "name the action" rule — no confirm-twice modal on
top of the password step, since re-entering a password already is the
confirmation. A wrong password shows an inline error (same `accent-red`
error-text pattern the login/signup form already uses, see §7's open
question on that screen's missing spec) and deletes nothing. On success
there is no account left to show anything else on, so the flow signs the
user out and lands back on the login/landing screen — no "deleted"
confirmation screen, nothing to confirm to once signed out.

### SCREEN-06: Scoring/live-updates explainer

```

**S-041, REQ-213.** Opened from the `(ⓘ)` entry point in SCREEN-01's
header, next to the round timer — a modal (`role="dialog"`,
`aria-modal="true"`), structurally the same backdrop-plus-card pattern
SCREEN-02's `GuessInput` already established (backdrop click closes it).
This modal goes further on two points `GuessInput` doesn't (yet — a known,
separate gap, not part of this story): Escape also closes it, and closing
it (by any method) returns focus to the `(ⓘ)` button that opened it,
rather than leaving keyboard/screen-reader focus stranded on a
now-invisible element. Deliberately not a full route/screen: it's a short,
general explanation, never gated behind having attempted any cell, and
reachable at any time an active round is showing. Content is general to the
mechanic, never cell-specific (no "your cell scored 12 pts" — that number
already lives on the cell itself).

**Content expanded (2026-07-14), requested directly by a player:** the
original three paragraphs (what a live estimate means and that it can
change, what a locked/final value means once the round closes, and — in
general terms, no exact formula — the golf-style/fewer-others-guessed
framing already established in SCREEN-03, ADR-0021) are still required,
joined by three more:
- The attempt count (`MAX_ATTEMPTS_PER_CELL`, 2) — a player asked directly
  whether this was documented anywhere, and it wasn't, despite being
  fundamental to how a guess even works (REQ-210).
- That a wrong guess locking at the maximum score (ADR-0021, already true
  and already shown per-cell as of today's SCREEN-01a fix) is the *same*
  maximum score an unanswered cell locks at once the round closes
  (`ScoreLockingService.MaterializeUnansweredCellsAsync`, S-028/ADR-0021)
  — the two were previously each documented in isolation (one per-cell,
  one only in `requirements-document.md`) with nothing connecting them for
  a player reading the explainer.
- The player-pool restriction (REQ-112/ADR-0025: male footballers born
  1939 or later only) — previously undocumented anywhere player-facing at
  all; without it, a technically-correct-but-out-of-scope name being
  rejected as "wrong" would look like a bug rather than an intentional
  scope boundary.

This is where SCREEN-01a's now-removed per-cell disclosure content (the
%-breakdown line, "updates until round closes on [date/time]") effectively
moved — see that section's S-041 note — except reworded to be general
rather than tied to one cell's specific numbers.

## 4. Responsive strategy

Unchanged from v0.1 — built "equally both" from the start:

- Layout defined per breakpoint at the component level, not one fluid
  layout reflowing.
- Grid cell minimum touch target: 44×44px on mobile regardless of grid
  size; a 5x5 on a narrow phone scrolls horizontally with sticky row/column
  headers rather than shrinking below that floor. **S-029 correction:**
  this floor only ever applied to the cells themselves — a Tier 0 3×3 grid
  was still forced into horizontal scroll on an ordinary phone because
  row/column header *label text* (a country/club name, nowrap, uncapped
  width — "Paris Saint-Germain," "United Kingdom") was wider than the
  screen, not because of the touch-target floor. Below a 480px viewport,
  header labels now wrap onto two lines and shrink their own width floor
  instead (`Grid.css`); the cell floor and the horizontal-scroll fallback
  itself are unchanged for whatever is still too wide (a larger grid, or a
  longer name still).

## 5. Copy and voice

Unchanged from v0.1:

- Active voice, name the action: "Submit guess," "Join league," "Create league."
- Errors state what happened and what to do, without apologizing.
- Empty states are invitations: "You're not in any custom leagues yet" +
  a "Create league" button.
- ~~The live/final distinction is a voice rule as much as visual — always
  say "live" or "final."~~ **Removed (2026-07-14, doc-sync miss from
  S-041):** S-041 already dropped this distinction from the cell entirely
  (no more "live"/"final" text anywhere in SCREEN-01a) — this bullet
  should have been removed in that story's own doc-sync pass and wasn't,
  caught only now while fixing state 3/4's "no attempts left" wording for
  the same reason.

## 6. Accessibility and quality floor

- Flags and badges are always paired with a text label — never the sole
  identifier for a category, both for accessibility and because emoji flag
  rendering varies across platforms/fonts.
- Correct/incorrect and attempts-remaining are never color-only signals
  (points values and attempt-count text are always real text, never
  icon/color alone). Live vs. final is no longer a distinction the cell
  itself makes at all as of S-041 — see SCREEN-01a and SCREEN-06. "No
  attempts left" as a distinct text label is also gone as of 2026-07-14
  (SCREEN-01a state 3's note) — a locked-incorrect cell's points value
  alone now carries that meaning, same as a correct cell's points alone.
- Visible keyboard focus state using `accent-green` as the focus ring color.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the badge-dock slide (§2), replacing it
  with an instant state change plus a brief color flash.
- Minimum 44×44px touch targets on all interactive elements.
- Sufficient contrast for gold-on-white and green-on-white text/icon use —
  **verified (S-013): both failed as originally specified (`accent-gold`
  2.6:1, `accent-green` 3.4:1 against `surface-card`); resolved via the new
  `accent-gold-text`/`accent-green-text` tokens in §2**, not by darkening
  the original tokens in place, since those remain correct for non-text/
  decorative use.

## 7. Open questions

- Whether a dark theme is ever offered as a user preference, now that light
  is the default (reversed from v0.1's "dark only" assumption)
- Whether the badge-dock animation is cheap enough in practice once built;
  if janky on low-end mobile, the reduced-motion fallback (instant + flash)
  may need to become the default rather than just the accessibility path
- (Phase 2) Fallback treatment when API-Football doesn't have a crest for a
  given club (lower-league/historical clubs) — likely the same generic
  initial-chip already used as v1's default, but not yet designed as an
  explicit "missing crest" state distinct from "v1 doesn't have crests at all"
- **No SCREEN-xx spec exists for the login/signup screen** (flagged by
  `ui-implementer` building S-010). Built functionally for Tier 0 —
  email/password fields, the REQ-701 age-confirmation checkbox, a "Log in"/
  "Sign up" tab toggle, tokens-only styling — but this document has no
  wireframe, copy, or state list for it the way SCREEN-01/01a/02 do. Needs a
  real SCREEN-00 entry (loading/submitting state, error copy, the exact
  tab/toggle pattern) rather than leaving the built version as the
  unreviewed de facto spec.
- **No SCREEN-xx spec exists for the post-login game-selection landing
  screen either** (`frontend/src/games/GameSelectScreen.tsx`, added S-021,
  REQ-303's UX addition). Same gap as SCREEN-00 above, same reasoning: kept
  deliberately minimal (a single tokens-only tile for xG Grid, no
  wireframe/copy/state review) since Tier 0 only ever has one game to
  select from — but once a second game exists this screen stops being
  trivial and needs a real spec (multi-tile layout, empty/loading states,
  copy) rather than staying an unreviewed de facto one.
- **§2 has no numeric spacing scale.** SCREEN-01/01a/02's implementation
  (S-010) used an unreviewed 4px-based scale (4/8/12/16/24/32/48) for
  padding/gaps in the absence of one, rather than one-off values per
  component. This should become a real token row in §2 (or be explicitly
  rejected in favor of per-component judgment) rather than staying an
  implementation-only convention future screens might diverge from.
- **§2 also has no type scale or border-radius scale**, a gap of the same
  kind as the spacing one above — found by `code-reviewer` on S-010's diff,
  since the first pass only disclosed the spacing gap. SCREEN-01/01a/02 and
  the login screen use ad-hoc, un-tokenized font sizes (9/10/11/12/13/14/
  15/16/18/22px, scattered across `CategoryLabel.css`, `CellState.css`,
  `Grid.css`, `GridScreen.css`, `GuessInput.css`, `AuthScreen.css`,
  `App.css`) and border-radius values (4/8/12px, in `Grid.css`,
  `GuessInput.css`, `AuthScreen.css`, `App.css`) with no shared variable
  behind either. Same recommendation as the spacing gap: turn these into
  real §2 token rows (a type scale, a radius scale) or explicitly decide
  per-component judgment is fine here — don't let it stay an
  implementation-only convention.
- ~~SCREEN-01a's revealed player name has no data source~~ — **fixed** the
  same session this was flagged: `GET /rounds/current`'s guess object now
  includes `SubmittedName` (REQ-303), so a cell answered before the current
  browser session can still show what was guessed after a reload. The
  client-side same-session cache (`GridScreen`'s `knownPlayerNames`) is kept
  only as the immediate-feedback path, since `POST .../guesses`' own
  response still doesn't echo the name back.
- ~~REQ-214's photo field name is still provisional~~ — **resolved**: the
  frontend's `resolvedPlayerPhotoUrl` guess (`CurrentRoundGuess`/
  `SubmitGuessResponse`, `frontend/src/lib/types.ts`) was checked against
  the backend's `ResolvedPlayerPhotoUrl` once it landed and matches
  exactly under the default camelCase JSON policy — no rename needed.
- ~~§2 has no overlay/scrim token for text-or-icon-on-photo contrast~~ —
  **resolved (2026-07-18, same session as the photo-decoupled-from-reveal
  status note; opacity lightened later the same day from 94% to 89% after
  visual feedback that 94% read as a heavy black shadow — see the
  `overlay-scrim` row above for the updated contrast math):**
  `overlay-scrim` (§2) is a band behind the checkmark/points/name overlay,
  calibrated against the worst case (a pure-white photo showing through)
  rather than a typical photo, at the lightest opacity that still clears
  the 4.5:1 floor for both overlaid foreground colors — pairs with
  `accent-gold` (not `accent-gold-text`) as the foreground color
  specifically on this token, the reverse of every other gold text/icon use
  in this document, since the darkened/lightened split is calibrated
  per-background-direction, not universally "always use the darkened one."
  `CellState.css`/`CellState.tsx` implement against this token directly —
  no bare `rgba()` value left untracked.
