# Notes

A running log of small, practical context that isn't worth a full ADR but
is worth remembering — gotchas discovered while building, quirks of a
third-party service, things that took longer than expected, "don't do X,
here's why" reminders. Think of this as the difference between:

- **`docs/decisions/*.md` (ADRs)**: formal, durable decisions with
  alternatives considered — "we chose X over Y because Z"
- **`docs/CHANGELOG.md`**: what changed in the *documentation*, dated
- **`NOTES.md` (this file)**: informal, accumulated context that doesn't
  fit either — the stuff you'd otherwise only remember by re-reading old
  chat history

Add an entry whenever something surprises you enough that you'd want to
have known it going in. Prune entries that stop being relevant (e.g. a
workaround for a bug that got fixed upstream) rather than letting this
grow forever — unlike the CHANGELOG, this file doesn't need to preserve
history, just current usefulness.

## Entries

### 2026-07-09 — Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi dropped from XGArcade.Api (S-001)
The default `dotnet new webapi` template pulls in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`
10.0.9, which transitively depends on `Microsoft.OpenApi` 2.0.0 — flagged by
NuGet (NU1903) as a known high-severity vulnerability
(GHSA-v5pm-xwqc-g5wc) across the *entire* 2.x line (checked every 2.x patch
release up to 2.6.1, all vulnerable). The 3.x line fixes it, but breaks the
AspNetCore.OpenApi 10.0.9 source generator (`OpenApiXmlCommentSupport`),
which was compiled against 2.x's API shape (`CS0200: 'IOpenApiMediaType.Example'
cannot be assigned to`). Since nothing in Tier 0 needs OpenAPI generation yet,
removed the package entirely rather than pinning around it — no
`AddOpenApi()`/`MapOpenApi()` calls, no Swagger UI. **If a future story needs
this** (e.g. `implementation-document.md` §4's planned typed API client,
"possibly generated via OpenAPI"), check whether a compatible
`Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` version exists yet before re-adding it — don't
just re-run `dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` and assume it
still works.
